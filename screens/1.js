1. Line 18 should be removed, as this is an unnecessary Text tag.
2. The DirectoryScreen onPress prop should not be passed in the Text tag; instead, it should be included in the MyStack navigator. 
3. The RecordInfoScreen should also be added to the MyStack navigator.
4. In the return statement, the two lines containing <DirectoryScreen> and <RecordInfoScreen> should also be removed.
